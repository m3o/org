# Organisation Docs

The Micro company handbook, product roadmap, team and contribution guide.

# Overview 

Micro is the fastest way to build, share and collaborate on services in the Cloud and beyond. Our goal is to continue on this mission in an 
open and collaborative way, both as a team and community. Up until now most of our ideas and development have revolved around discussions in 
[Slack](https://slack.m3o.com).

This repo serves as an open forum for collaboration, design docs and the roadmap.
